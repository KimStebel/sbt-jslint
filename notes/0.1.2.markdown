- Fixed format for Jenkins integration [#4][4] ([jzsfkzm][2])
- Fixed the `ShortFormatter` to respect new format
- Fixed explode to display short summary and write to file
- `watch` will now work with specified js sources

### Backward compatibility notes

- `ShortFormatter` expects to be instantiated with a source directory.
  Something like this will suffice:

        import LintKeys.{
          jslint, formatter,
          jslintConsoleOutput => consoleOut
        }

        formatter in (Compile, consoleOut) <<= (sourceDirectory in jslint) (ShortFormatter)
